## Changing Text on Clicks
We often see in websites that a specific change occurs when we click a button. That is all done by using JavaScript. In this project, I will show you how we can change 'Text' whenever we click a button that is actually a base for what I said in the first line.

## Explantion of how I did it:
First of all I created HTML file and CSS file, its tottaly up to you, how you want to structure your page and style it. But for this tutorial, two elemnets of HTML are necessary: ``` <p></p> ``` in which we have put the text that will be chnaged when we will click ```<button></Button>. 
Creat a paragrapgh and a button and style it however you like. The core of this tutorial is to change the text of inside ```<p></p>``` and also innertext of ```<buuton></button>```, on clicking that button.
